**📊 HR Data Analytics
📌 Overview**

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and visualizing HR-related datasets.
The goal of this project was to apply basic data analytics techniques to understand patterns and trends in HR data and gain insights that could inform decisions such as employee retention and performance evaluation.

⚠️ Note: This project is an analysis prototype and does not represent backend or API functionality. It serves as part of my learning journey in data analysis, separate from my current focus on backend and open-source contribution.
